# BME-147-Project
We are trying to see if Females have an inherent advantage in detecting AI-generated music apart from Human-generated music. We will be implementing Logistic Regression, a discriminative model, to see if being a female increases the odds for detecting AI-music. If time permits, we will use a genrative model to see if how different mechanics can come to the same result in classifying.

Go to README.pdf to see the results and for more in depth explanation.
